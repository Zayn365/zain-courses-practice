# MERNSTACK CRUD APPLICATION
 - I used MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS to build this application. The functionality is straightforward: upon the first render, all data will be displayed. After that, an option to add a new todo will appear. This will be added to the existing todos, and two buttons will be displayed next to each todo: Update and Remove. You can select either one to update or remove the corresponding todo. If you choose to update, a form will pop up, allowing you to make changes, which will then be saved to the database. The same goes for remove; the corresponding todo will be deleted. (NOTE: I have removed my URI from the code for privacy purposes. Anyone can use the code for themselves.)

# TODO THINGS
